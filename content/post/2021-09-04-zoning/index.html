<h2>What is allowable floor area ratio?</h2>
<p>Part of the zoning code restricts something called the <strong><em>floor area ratio (FAR)</em></strong>. A shorthand way of thinking about <em>allowable</em> FAR is just how high you are allowed to build on a given lot. When the allowable-FAR is 2.0 a developer can build a 2-story building on her lot, when her allowable FAR is 1.0 then she can only build on 1-story building<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Allowable FAR is on of the few standardized numeric metrics for measuring how restrictive the zoning code is.</p>
<p>The chart below measures the proportion of lots in the 5 boroughs the were upzoned/downzoned during the Bloomberg administration.</p>
